## Subreddit Predictions
The purpose of this project is to create a Machine Learning Model which can read a reddit post title and predict which subreddit it belongs to. 
The project will be broken up into steps which can be separated into three main sections, each of which gets its own Notebook.

### Preliminary Assessment
1: Identify the Problem      
2: Aquire and Pre-Clean the Data     
3: Inspect the Data by Hand          
4: Initial Feature Analysis      
5: Naive Solution      
6: Establish Goals     
7: Speculation on Further Improvements     

### Systematic Approach
8: Create New Models     
9: Compare and Analyze Results     
10: Choose a "Winning" Model

### Optimization
11: optimize the Winning Model     
12: Analyze Final Results     
13: Suggest Future Improvements
